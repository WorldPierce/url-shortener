Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- database 'mongodb' hosted on mlab.com
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
